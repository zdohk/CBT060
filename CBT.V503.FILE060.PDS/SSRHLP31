      This panel is displayed once for every new product you added under the
 previous ADD PTF/MOD ENTRY panel. This panel allows you to change the
 ACRONYM, PRODUCT NAME, RELEASE, FMID and ORDER NUMBER you entered in the
 previous panel, and requires you to enter a VENDOR and CATEGORY for the new
 product.
      Enter the product's VENDOR. If the VENDOR does not already exist on the
 Software Status database, enter a "Y" after NEW VENDOR. If the VENDOR already
 exists, enter the name exactly as it appears on the database and leave NEW
 VENDOR blank. If you are not sure of the VENDOR, enter an asterisk (*) in the
 VENDOR field; you will be shown a list of existing VENDORs from which you may
 select.
      Follow the same procedure for CATEGORY (CATEGORY is generally descriptive
 of the product's function; examples: OS, TSO, TELEPROCESSING, OPERATIONS
 MANAGEMENT etc. VENDOR and CATEGORY are used as indices both for on-line
 display of PRODUCTs and for organizing the hard copy Software Status Report).

      Press ENTER to process the new product or END to return to the previous
 ADD PTF/MOD ENTRY panel without processing.
