 (optional), FMID (optional), ORDER number (optional), and PRODUCT NAME
 (required). PRODUCT NAME can be up to two lines of 32 characters each and is
 entered under ACRONYM.

 does not already exist, place a "Y" in the NEW PRODUCT column. This will add
 a new product to the database). Press ENTER again to to continue.
