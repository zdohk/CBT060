      This panel displays detailed maintenance history entries for one product.
 All fields are changeable by overtyping. Changing the VENDOR or CATEGORY name
 will change VENDOR or CATEGORY for this product only (unlike the LIST PRODUCT
 panel). Changing the DATE INSTALLED will cause the maintenance entries to be
 reordered on the screen, since they are listed in chronological order.
 Individual maintenance entries may be deleted, or the entire product and all
 its maintenance entries can be deleted (DELETE PRODUCT).
      Eight maintenance entries are displayed on this panel. DOWN will either
 display the next eight maintenance entries for this same product, if there are
 any, or display the next product within the current search argument. UP always
 moves back to the first maintenance entry of the prior product within the
 current search argument.
