      This panel displays existing products on the Software Status database.
 Products are displayed alphabetically by PRODUCT NAME.
      If you arrived here from the Software Status MENU (Option 2), display
 is limited to products fitting any search argument you may have specified. If
 no search criteria was specified, all existing products are displayed.
 Selecting a product (S) will display detail maintenance history for that
 product.
      If you arrived here from the LIST VENDOR or LIST CATEGORY panel, display
 is limited to products within the VENDOR or CATEGORY you selected. Selecting a
 product (S) will display detail maintenance history for the product.
      When displaying products for a VENDOR or CATEGORY, you have the option of
 changing the VENDOR or CATEGORY field. When you do so, all products under the
 old VENDOR or CATEGORY will now fall under the new one. If the VENDOR or
 CATEGORY has no products, you are given the option to delete the VENDOR or
 CATEGORY. Type a "D" in the DELETE field & press ENTER.
      If you arrived here from the ADD PTF/MOD ENTRY panel (by typing an
 asterisk in ACRONYM or PRODUCT NAME), all existing products are displayed.
 Selecting a product (S) will cause the PRODUCT and its most recent FMID, ORDER
 and RELEASE to be placed in the ADD PTF/MOD panel entry. (NOTE: You will be
 brought to this panel once for each entry you placed an asterisk in).
